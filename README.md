# cuisine.git

KISS Repository of open recipes. Simply find or write your personal recipes in
the recipes folder, in the MIAM (Miam Inside Advanced Markdown) syntax.
A Python script, cuisine.py, helps you finding the perfect recipe for your
meals. The options list is available by typing `./cuisine.py --help`.

## But… WHY??

Because I’m hungry. Everytime. “Cuisine” is the french for “kitchen/cooking”,
and “miam” is also the french for “yum” (this is not fedora-related, AFAIK).
Also, there are a lot of websites that show open source recipes, but those lack
a simple format for the raw data.

## MIAM syntax

A MIAM file is basically a text file following the
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) rules. In addition of
those, you can use metadata to help good indexing of the recipe.
The category of a recipe is given by its parent folder. Its language is given by
the extension (for example, [tartiflette.en.miam](tartiflette.en.miam) for the recipe for *tartiflette*
in english).
